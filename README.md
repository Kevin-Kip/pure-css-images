## Images created using pure CSS 
That's right. :smile:
This code was written as a completion of the course on CSS images.
Original course document on building the koala can be found [here](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2).

## You want to use this code?
Fine by me. Follow these steps:
1. Clone/denload the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. Right click and `open in terminal`
4. Run `live-server`

> This is assuming that you have [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) installed. If not, you can always do a quick `npm install -g live-server`.  

Alternatively, run the code the old fashioned `file:///pathToIndexFile` way.

## Why?
Well, there are a number of reasons:

1. fun :wink:
2. to gain a deeper understanding of CSS :muscle:
3. to pass time 
4. any other reason you want

## Result?
